# Dog Eared Books

Dog Eared Books was originally created as a static website created for a school project using only HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This repository contains the website during it's transition to Ruby on Rails. 

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3, Bootstrap 4.1.1
* JavaScript, jQuery
* Ruby on Rails 5.2.1
* Ruby 2.5.0
* SQLite 3.22.0

## Motivation

The main objective for the creation of this website is to practice building web-applications using the framework Ruby on Rails. This is my first experience using this framework. All my development in Rails has been for personal projects. Hopefully these skills will assist in developing professional websites in the future.
 
## Goals for the Site

The finished website will be an eCommerce bookstore that is designed to be used by a user acting as one of two roles. The user will either be an author or a customer. Depending on the user's role the experience with Dog Eared Books will be different. The authors will be able to add their books to the store through a page only accessible with a valid account. The customer will be able to browse and purchase these books through the online catalog. The eCommerce platform to be used has not been chosen and will be available at a later date.
